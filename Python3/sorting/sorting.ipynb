    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following version of Bubble Sort:\n",
    "___\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "    // Track number of elements swapped during a single array traversal\n",
    "    int numberOfSwaps = 0;\n",
    "    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {\n",
    "        // Swap adjacent elements if they are in decreasing order\n",
    "        if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) {\n",
    "            swap(a[j], a[j + 1]);\n",
    "            numberOfSwaps++;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // If no elements were swapped during a traversal, array is sorted\n",
    "    if (numberOfSwaps == 0) {\n",
    "        break;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Task\n",
    "Given an array, ***a***, of size ***n*** distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following **3** lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.`<br>\n",
    "where ***numSwaps*** is the number of swaps that took place.\n",
    "* `First Element: firstElement`<br>\n",
    "where ***firstElement*** is the first element in the sorted array.\n",
    "* `Last Element: lastElement`<br>\n",
    "where ***lastElement*** is the last element in the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "***a = [4, 3, 1, 2]***\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "original a: 4 3 1 2\n",
    "round 1  a: 3 1 2 4 swaps this round: 3\n",
    "round 2  a: 1 2 3 4 swaps this round: 2\n",
    "round 3  a: 1 2 3 4 swaps this round: 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the first round, the **4** is swapped at each of the **3** comparisons, ending in the last position. In the second round, the **3** is swapped at **2** of the **3** comparisons. Finally, in the third round, no swaps are made so the iterations stop. The output is the following:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Array is sorted in 5 swaps.\n",
    "First Element: 1\n",
    "Last Element: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains an integer, , the number of elements in array ***a***.\n",
    "The second line contains ***n*** space-separated integers that describe ***a[0],a[1],...,a[n - 1]***.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2 <= n <= 600**\n",
    "* **1 <= a[i] <= 2 x (10^6)**, *where* **0 <= i <= n**.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Print the following three lines of output:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.`<br>\n",
    "where ***numSwaps*** is the number of swaps that took place.\n",
    "* `First Element: firstElement`<br>\n",
    "where ***firstElement*** is the first element in the sorted array.\n",
    "* `Last Element: lastElement`<br>\n",
    "where ***lastElement*** is the last element in the sorted array.\n",
    "##### Sample Input 0\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "3\n",
    "1 2 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Sample Output 0\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Array is sorted in 0 swaps.\n",
    "First Element: 1\n",
    "Last Element: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Explanation 0\n",
    "The array is already sorted, so **0** swaps take place and we print the necessary **3** lines of output shown above.\n",
    "##### Sample Input 1\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "3\n",
    "3 2 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Sample Output 1\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Array is sorted in 3 swaps.\n",
    "First Element: 1\n",
    "Last Element: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Explanation 1\n",
    "The array ***a = [3, 2, 1]*** is not sorted, so we perform the following ***3*** swaps. Each line shows ***a*** after each single element is swapped.<br>\n",
    " 1. [3,2,1] &#8594; [2,3,1]\n",
    " 2. [2,3,1] &#8594; [2,1,3]\n",
    " 3. [2,1,3] &#8594; [1,2,3]\n",
    "\n",
    "After ***3*** swaps, the array is sorted."
