    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: ***fine = 0***).\n",
    "2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, ***fine = 15coins x (the number of days late)***.\n",
    "3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, ***fine = 500coins x (the number of months late)***.\n",
    "4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of ***1000 coins***.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "* **d1,m1,y1 = 12312014** returned date\n",
    "* **d2,m2.y2 = 112015** due date\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is returned on time, so no fine is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **d1,m1,y1 = 112015** returned date\n",
    "* **d2,m2.y2 = 12012014** due date\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is returned in the following year, so the fine is a fixed **10000**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line contains **3** space-separated integers denoting the respective ***day, month,*** and ***year*** on which the book was actually returned.\n",
    "The second line contains **3** space-separated integers denoting the respective ***day, month,*** and ***year*** on which the book was expected to be returned *(due date)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constraints\n",
    "* ***1 <= D <= 31***\n",
    "* ***1 <= M <= 12***\n",
    "* ***1 <= Y <= 3000***\n",
    "* It is guaranteed that the dates will be valid Gregorian calendar dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sample Input\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "STDIN       Function\n",
    "-----       --------\n",
    "9 6 2015    day = 9, month = 6, year = 2015 (date returned)\n",
    "6 6 2015    day = 6, month = 6, year = 2015 (date due)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sample Output\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "45\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the following return dates:\n",
    "Returned: ***D1 = 9, M1 = 6, Y1 = 2015***\n",
    "Due: ***D2 = 6, M2 = 6, Y2 = 2015***\n",
    "\n",
    "* Because ***Y2 $\\equiv$ Y1***, it is less than a year late.\n",
    "* Because ***M2 $\\equiv$ M1***, it is less than a month late.\n",
    "* Because ***D2 < D1***, it was returned late (but still within the same month and year).\n",
    "\n",
    "Per the library's fee structure, we know that our fine will be ***15 coins x (# days late)***. We then print the result of ***15 x (D1 - D2) = 15 x (9 - 6) = 45*** as our output."
