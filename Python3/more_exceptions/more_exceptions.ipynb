    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Calculator class with a single method: ***int power(int,int)***. The power method takes two integers, ***n*** and ***p***, as parameters and returns the integer result of ***n^p***. If either ***n*** or ***p*** is negative, then the method must throw an exception with the message: `n and p should be non-negative`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Do not use an access modifier (e.g.: public) in the declaration for your Calculator class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Input from stdin is handled for you by the locked stub code in your editor. The first line contains an integer, ***T***, the number of test cases. Each of the ***T*** subsequent lines describes a test case in  space-separated integers that denote ***n*** and ***p***, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "* No Test Case will result in overflow for correctly written code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Output to stdout is handled for you by the locked stub code in your editor. There are ***T*** lines of output, where each line contains the result of ***n^p*** as calculated by your **Calculator class'** power method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sample Input\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "4\n",
    "3 5\n",
    "2 4\n",
    "-1 -2\n",
    "-1 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "##### Sample Output\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "243\n",
    "16\n",
    "n and p should be non-negative\n",
    "n and p should be non-negative\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation\n",
    "* ***T = 4***\n",
    "* ***T0***: **3** and **5** are positive, so power returns the result of **3^5**, which is **243**.\n",
    "* ***T1***: **2** and **4** are positive, so power returns the result of **2^4**, which is **16**.\n",
    "* ***T2***: Both inputs (**-1** and **-2**) are negative, so *power* throws an exception and `n and p should be non-negative` is printed.\n",
    "* ***T3***: One of the inputs (**-1**) is negative, so *power* throws an exception and `n and p should be non-negative` is printed."
